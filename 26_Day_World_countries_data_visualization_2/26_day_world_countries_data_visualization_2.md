During 26's day challange I code countries data visualization 2 project. You can search letter or word to find countries. What's more you have options for that! You can only display countries which start with your input value or which include the input value!

-About Project-
In the begging there are 3 buttons and one input. You can click one button and can search in the data. I used same data here as well (data > countries_data). When you start typing bottom of the page you can see the results. Every alters will effect the view. In the paragraph  you can also see how many match you had. With last button you can reverse you results.

-Code Sample-
The most exciting part for me was searching by starting word.

In this algorithm I had to slice countries name as long as the search length. When I got the important part of the name I converted them to lower case to prevent mistakes of different letters. End of the process I push result to the array.
